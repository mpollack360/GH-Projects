# Innovation Labs
<a id="markdown-innovation-labs" name="innovation-labs"></a>
The Innovation Lab is the opportunity for OCI to showcase our collective capabilities in solving business problems using technology in new and innovative ways. These demonstrations will be installed in the office to allow those visiting the OCI office to explore our solutions.

One of the goals of Innovation Labs projects is to help provide developers with a consistent experience. Much the same as static analysis tools provide consistency within a code base, the practices and processes of a project provide the same consistency across the entire codebase.

This repository template should be used as a starting point. It is assumed that projects may have needs that do not fit the processes described in the template and different strategies may work better. This template should be viewed as a living document that can be altered and updated as necessary to provide meaningful information to developers.
